# i22_bimorph_nn

A PyTorch nn to position i22's bimorph mirror

This is where you should write a short paragraph that describes what your module does,
how it does it, and why people should use it.

PyPI            | `pip install i22-bimorph-nn`
Docker          | `docker run ghcr.io/diamondrc/i22-bimorph-nn:latest`

This is where you should put some images or code snippets that illustrate
some relevant examples. If it is a library then you might put some
introductory code here:

```python
from i22_bimorph_nn import __version__

print(f"Hello i22_bimorph_nn {__version__}")
```

Or if it is a commandline tool then you might put some example commands here:

```
python -m i22_bimorph_nn --version
```
